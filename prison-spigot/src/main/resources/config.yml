# NEW: Non-Functional at this time. Coming soon!
# This is strictly a work in progress right now, and does not work yet.
# This uses a new prison block model for providing the internal block lists
# and for generating the blocks.  This allows usage from mc 1.8.x through 
# v1.16.x and enables all new blocks for the version the server is running.
# This new model currently does not support custom blocks.

# NEW: Non-functional. Coming soon!
# Prison mines reset gap is the number of milliseconds that are used to 
# space out the mine resets when starting the server.  This value should 
# not be changed unless you understand what you are doing. This value
# is converted to ticks, so should use 50 millisecond increments. If too 
# small of a value is used then it could produce a large amount of lag 
# if more than one mine tries to reset at the same time, or close to each
# other.  This may be changed to ticks in the near future.
