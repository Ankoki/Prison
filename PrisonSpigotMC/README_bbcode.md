This pertains to the bbcode that is within this directory:


The targeted editor is the bbcode editor on the spigotmc.org site.  It is recognized that most people will not have access to the editor.  In order to use it, or have access to the editor, a resource needs to be edited.  If such an editor cannot be used, then the following may be a substitution but strictly follow the guidelines.




If you are unable to have access to a spigotmc.org editor, then the following could be used, but with caution.  Use at your own risk, but it can be a reasonable fall-back.

The following editor works and will show how the page will render (mostly), but the images are not properly sized, when compared to spigotmc.org.  This is good for editing text, but do not use this editor to format any images; keep the image sizes the way they are.  It probably is also a good idea not to use this editor for tweaking sizes or spaces either, since minor things like that may render differently on spigotmc.org too.
