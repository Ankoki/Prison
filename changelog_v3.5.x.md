## Prison Build Logs for v3.5.x

Greetings!  I'm delighted that you are interested in the build logs for the
Prison plugin.  I'm wanting to provide a more formal documentation as to what 
is going on in each build so you have a better idea if it may be something 
that you need.

I'm unofficially taking over the prison project because I need to use it on my
server that I'm starting to build, therefore it's in my best interest to address
open bugs and to add in some new features.  I honestly cannot commit to anything
long term, but I hope to at least bring this project up to date (support 1.13.x)
and address some of the outstanding bugs.  If I can leave this in a slightly 
better state from what I found it, then I will consider this a success.


## tag v3.5.1 - 2019-11-11

I updated minimal resources to get a clean gradle build.  I think I have the core
basics figured out on how to use gradle so I can hopefully provide quicker responses
in the future when I need to.

* **Updates to bStats**  The Maven repository was updated and so was the version of
bStats that is being included on the project.  It is now using the current 1.5 version, 
was using 1.3 which is no longer available in the repository and was causing a build
failure for gradle.

* **Update to org.inventivetalent.spiget-update** Updated to version 1.4.2-SNAPSHOT since
the old version 1.4.0 was no longer available. 

**Build artifacts:**
  I think going forward I will include the tagged version in the jar file name. Also, 
  unless someone provides a good reason not to, I will also include the sponge version
  since it is being generated, although at this time I have no means to test that artifact.
  * **prison_v3.5.1.jar** 
  * **prison-sponge_v3.5.1.jar**
  
**Notes for Future Reference:** The build artifacts are generated by running the Gradle command
**gradlew build --info** (--info optional) and can be found in the two files:
 * **Prison/prison-spigot/build/libs/Prison.jar**
 * **Prison/prison-sponge/build/libs/Prison-sponge.jar**

## tag v3.5.0 - 2019-11-08

As soon as I forked this plugin, I tagged it to version 3.5.0 to set a steak in the
ground and to establish the versioning.  I cannot provide build artifacts because
the project will not compile as is.  It's important that for this first tag/version
that I have zero changes and commits.

This is my first GitHub project and also my first exposure to Gradle so I want to 
take my time and do this right and provide good documentation so it is easier
to follow my reasoning for why I'm doing what I am doing.

I decided to go with version 3.5.0 since I do not want to conflict with the 
main project's upcoming v4.0.0. I've jumped to 3.5.x to signify that there is a
new developer taking over and there may be slightly new directions in which 
this project may head.  I'm also thinking about Apache's projects that have used
the jump to the x.5.x version such as what Tomcat had with v5.5.x and v8.5.x; 
different enough to jump ahead on the 
**api version**, but not radically different enough to warrant a new **generation version**.
