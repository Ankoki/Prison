## Setting up Vault

This document provides a quick overview on how to install Vault.

Vault may be optional, but it is a very important plugin.  It provides easy integration with economies and permissions.  This is useful because its a standard way for prison to hook in and use any plugin that supports Vault.

Prison uses Vault to connect to Economies and Permissions.

# Note about CMI Economy and Vault

CMI Economy has special requirements and needs special configuration settings to enable Prison to work properly.

Please see the following documentation on how to configure Vault, CMI Economy, and Prison:

# Optional Dependencies

Vault doesn't have any "required" dependencies, but Vault will be useless if there were no other plugins to hook in to it.

Two kinds of plugins to use with Vault are economy and permission plugins.  If you don't have your own preference for these, then it is strongly suggested that EssentialsX and LuckPerms are used.
