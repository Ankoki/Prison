# 3.2.11-alpha.1 2021-08-24


* **Tweaks to the event listener dumps for block breaks.**
Updated the notes about prison's listeners.
PEExplosionEvent was setup with the wrong forClass name.


* **Setting up a new way to handle block updates in prison.  Adding functions that are intended to be use while running in an async threads.**


* **Transitioning over to the correct way to get the compatibility object.**
Just a few classes are using the old way, but they will be switched over when they are done with the edits.


* **Fixed the way some of the language files were being generated**
so it can include the spigot module, which makes it self-contained for actual Modules, since it's always based upon the module name. 
Core and spigot are not technically modules, so they have special setups.
Changed the Module folder from dataFolder to moduleDataFolder so it would not conflict with the SpigotPrison object.


* **Fixed  a problem with Prison's ExplosiveBlockBreakHandler**
 in that it has a typo in the getHandlerList() and was not included with the registration processes. It also needed to be included with the generation of the listener dumps.


* **Added /sellall hand command.**


* **Minor changes to SellAll Util.**


* **Much better performance for SellAll generally.**


* **SellAll Commands internal changes.**


* **Minor changes to GUIs:** Some fixes and visual changes.


* **SellAllUtil Rewrite:** New internals for SellAll and SellAll API.

# v3.2.8 2021-06-17

Prison V3.2.8 Release!
Prison now fully support Spigot 1.17 and Java 16!


**NOTE:** Since the start of the development on v3.3.0, Prison has had a few other releases under v3.2.7 and v3.2.8.  The reason for these releases is that the major structures (and code) that would make prison v3.4.x, are not complete.  Therefore, to get out new updates sooner than later, v3.2.7 and v3.2.8 have been release.


* **Released v3.2.8!**


* **v3.2.8-alpha.3 2021-06-16**


* **v3.2.8-alpha.2 2021-06-12**

* **Spigot 1.17 release - v3.2.8-alpha.1 - 2021-06-11**
Only known issues: 
   * Unable to use nms to get the player's preferred language

* **v3.2.8-alpha.1 2021-06-07**
Internally set the version, but will not release it until a few other things are finished.
The prison version is set to 3.2.8-alpha.1 to prepare for the release of prison that is compatible with Java 16 and Spigot 1.17.


NOTE: v3.2.8-alpha.1 is identical to v3.3.0-alpha.6.  V3.3.0 is far from being ready to be released.  So v3.2.8 will enable Java 16 and also Minecraft 1.17.


# v3.3.0-alpha.6 2021-06-07


* **v3.3.0-alpha.6 2021-06-07**
Setting the version.  The v3.3.0 release will be put on hold since focus will be to get v3.2.8 out which will support Java 16.  It is unknown how many of the spigot 1.17 blocks will be initially supported.

* **v3.3.0-alpha.5c - 2021-06-06**

* **v3.3.0-alpha.5 2021-06-01**

* **v3.3.0-alpha.4 2021-05-15**

v3.2.6, v3.3.0-alpha.1, v3.3.0-alpha.2, v3.2.7, v3.3.0-alpha.3
